# Meetup-Social-Dev-App

A social application for IT employees. The user can create an account, create his profile by providing the most important information, add a post and comment on the posts of others.

Frontend layer prepared in React. Backend layer prepared in Node. Numerous npm packages were used in the application. Axios was used for communication. The application connects to the MongoDB database. The application has been implemented on the Heroku server.

You can create a new account (the gravatar package was used to use the avatar - gravatar account is needed) or use a demo account.

Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, Heroku.

*The application is available only via the link. The application has demo data. The application is fully functional - the user can create an account. The GIT repository has a preview function, do not install extensions because the application has deliberately deleted files containing sensitive data.

**The application uses a free Heroku account. Heroku account sleeps, so the first loading of the application may take longer.
