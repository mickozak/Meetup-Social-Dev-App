# Meetup-Social-Dev-App

A social application for IT employees. The user can create an account, create his profile by providing the most important information, add a post and comment on the posts of others.

Frontend layer prepared in React. Backend layer prepared in Node. Numerous npm packages were used in the application. Axios was used for communication. The application connects to the MongoDB database. The application has been implemented on the Heroku server.

You can create a new account (the gravatar package was used to use the avatar - gravatar account is needed) or use a demo account (more information in the link above).

The application uses a free Heroku account. Heroku account sleeps, so the first loading of the application may take longer.
